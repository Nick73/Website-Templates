## üöÄ About

This repository contains a growing set of **HTML/CSS website starters** ‚Äî minimal, clean, and ready for rapid prototyping or client work. Each template is built with plain HTML/CSS (no frameworks or build steps required) so you can quickly modify and deploy.

These templates are ideal for:

- Freelancers who want to present **multiple design options** to clients.
- Beginners who want to study and adapt real layouts.
- Developers who need a fast starting point for static sites.
- Works great with my [Website Tester](https://github.com/Nick73/website-tester)
